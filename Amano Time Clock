If you look carefully at a neon sign, you will observe the letters on it don't lay flat. Neon doesn't have a color and so there are different other types of gases and chemicals in there too.

The first neon sign was proudly shown in 1983. It certainly got a great offer of attention at the World's Fair in Illinois.

In order to make neon indications safe, televisions are made from lead glass. It is very difficult and very long-lasting to break. When the power is turned on to the indication, the neon is heated up. Yet it will not fume enough to cause the glass or the sign to explode. Neon is extremely safe so people do not need to worry about it. Need a neon indication to get broken though it won't work as it should. It will have to be repaired or changed.
