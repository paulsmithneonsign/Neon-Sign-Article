With the popularity of Internet shopping, traditional toys that were hard to discover, have now started to find an entire brand-new audience. These classics, which sold effectively after they were presented, never appear to head out of style and can still bring a smile to any kid's face.

Let's step into the past and take a look into the history of one of these classic toys.

In 1943, a Naval engineer accidentally knocked some springs off of a shelf while he was dealing with a meter designed to monitor horsepower on battleships. He marveled at the method they "walked" rather than falling and the odd movement of these springs offered Richard James an idea and an immediate toy was born. That toy: The Slinky.

Richard James then spent the next two years screening and fine-tuning the very best steel gauge and coil to use for his brand-new toy. His better half, Betty appropriately found the ideal name for this new toy- a Slinky; which is the Swedish word significance trae spiral or smooth.

The couple borrowed five hundred dollars and James developed a maker to coil eighty feet of wire into a two-inch spiral and manufacture their new toy. Sales were slow initially, however skyrocketed after the Slinky was demonstrated at Gimbels Department Store in Philadelphia for the Christmas season in 1945. The first 400 sold within a brand-new fad and the ninety-minute demonstration had started.

Around 1960, Richard James suffered what some called a mid-life crisis and left his wife, their six kids and joined a Bolivian religious cult. He also deserted the Slinky toy he worked so difficult to produce and left the business in debt and mess up. Betty James took control as CEO of James Industries and introduced other toys for the "Slinky line-up" including: Slinky family pets, crazy eyes Slinky (glasses with Slinky-extended fake eyeballs), neon Slinky, and also changed the original black-blue Swedish steel with American steel. Additionally she moved the business headquarters from Philadelphia to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania and started an aggressive ad campaign, complete with the now famous Slinky jingle:

" What strolls down stairs, alone in pairs, And makes a Slinky noise?
A spring, a spring, a marvelous thing, Everyone understands it's Slinky ...
It's Slinky, it's Slinky, for fun it's a wonderful toy
It's Slinky, it's Slinky, it's fun for a kid or a woman"

However, the Slinky is not simply an amusing toy for children. It is used in schools in physics classes to show wave residential or commercial properties, forces, and energy states. The Slinky still continues to offer (250 million have actually been offered to date) and are still produced in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania using the original equipment developed by Richard James.

That toy: The Slinky.

He also deserted the Slinky toy he worked so tough to produce and left the company in debt and mess up. Betty James took over as CEO of James Industries and introduced other toys for the "Slinky line-up" consisting of: Slinky animals, insane eyes Slinky (glasses with Slinky-extended fake eyeballs), neon Slinky, and also replaced the initial black-blue Swedish steel with American steel. The Slinky is not simply an entertaining toy for kids.
